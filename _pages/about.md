Hi! I’m Hannah.

I’m an [assistant professor](https://philosophy.arizona.edu/person/hannah-kim) at the University of Arizona's philosophy department and a faculty affiliate with the [Center for East Asian Studies](https://ceas.arizona.edu/).  I'm also an editor for the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/).

I work on aesthetics, metaphysics, and Asian philosophy. My favorite topics are found at their intersections (e.g., fictional truth, fictional time, Confucian aesthetics).

I also freelance and write about philosophy, culture, and the arts for a general audience.  I'm a Contributor at [Aesthetics for Birds](https://aestheticsforbirds.com/), and my writings have appeared in [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-fiction-philosophy-consciousness/), [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-07/vaccine-conspiracy-theories-fictions-philosophy), [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2022/06/30/multiverse-marvel-uvalde-roe/9997384002/?gnt-cfr=1), [Public Seminar](https://publicseminar.org/essays/what-a-korean-american-will-find-in-minari/), and [The Philosopher](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/life-as-a-non-standard-narrative), among other places. My interviews have appeared on [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/video/philosophy-covid-e1keqx/) and [Arizona Public Media (PBS/NPR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QQWqYe3_S8).

Before joining Arizona, I taught at Macalester College. And before that, I received my PhD in Philosophy and PhD minor in Comparative Literature from Stanford.
