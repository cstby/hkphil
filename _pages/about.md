Hi! I’m Hannah.

I’m a philosophy professor at the [University of Arizona](https://philosophy.arizona.edu/person/hannah-kim). I’m also an editor for the [*Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](https://plato.stanford.edu/).

I work on aesthetics (esp. literature and music), metaphysics, and Asian philosophy. My favorite topics are found at their intersections.

I’m also committed to public philosophy. My writings have appeared in [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-fiction-philosophy-consciousness/), [*LA Times*](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-07/vaccine-conspiracy-theories-fictions-philosophy), [*USA Today*](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2022/06/30/multiverse-marvel-uvalde-roe/9997384002/?gnt-cfr=1), [*Public Seminar*](https://publicseminar.org/essays/what-a-korean-american-will-find-in-minari/), [*The Philosopher*](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/life-as-a-non-standard-narrative), and [*Aesthetics for Birds*](https://aestheticsforbirds.com/2022/08/25/park-jiwon-on-why-crows-arent-black/), among others.

Before joining Arizona, I taught at Macalester College. And before that, I received my PhD in Philosophy and PhD minor in Comparative Literature from Stanford.
